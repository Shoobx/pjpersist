* get rid of the remaining conflict handler stuff

* add some tests for interleaved transactions

  - raise a specific Exception on a conflict (to be converted to Retry somewhere)

* performance optimizations:

  - now pjpersist does an INSERT and an UPDATE when adding an object,
    bring it down to one INSERT

    ( in cases of people[None] = Person(u"name") )

  - think about how to batch SQL commands
    e.g. in `PJDataManager._flush_objects`
