* get rid of the remaining conflict handler stuff

* add some tests for interleaved transactions

  - raise a specific Exception on a conflict (to be converted to Retry somewhere)

* performance optimizations:

  - now pjpersist does an INSERT and an UPDATE when adding an object,
    bring it down to one INSERT

    ( in cases of people[None] = Person(u"name") )

  - think about how to batch SQL commands
    e.g. in `PJDataManager._flush_objects`

  - think about implementing an object cache per connection and providing
    invalidation messages as ZEO (and maybe relstorage? does)
    see ZODB / collaborations.txt

  - use ujson instead of the built-in json module:

  - crazy idea: make UPDATEs and INSERTs async, wait for those async operations
    to complete before SELECTs and COMMIT
    IOW, do UPDATEs and INSERTs in a thread, join() the threads before SELECTs
